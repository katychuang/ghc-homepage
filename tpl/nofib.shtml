<title>The NoFib Haskell benchmark suite</title>

<h1>The NoFib benchmark suite</h1>
<!-- ================================================== -->

We are very keen to encourage the collection of a good suite of
Haskell programs to use as benchmarks.  We have made a start, by
collecting the <strong>NoFib</strong> suite. It has three main
collections of programs: 

<ul> 
<li> The <em>imaginary</em> part consists of toy programs such as
nqueens and Ackermann's function.  Such programs are useless for
drawing general conclusions, but can sometimes show up nasty
performance bugs in sharp relief.
<p>
<li> The <em>spectral</em> part consists of kernels of real
programs, such as Fast Fourier Transform.  Again, one should be
careful about drawing any general conclusions from these programs, but
they are a whole lot more realistic than the imaginary suite whilst
still being of modest size.
<p>
<li> The <em>real</em> part consists of real application programs,
written by people who simply wanted to get the job done.  They are
larger and more I/O intensive than the imaginary and spectral suite.
</ul>
<p>
The NoFib suite and the ideas behind it is presented in more detail in the
following paper:

</ul>

We are very keen indeed to expand the range of the NoFib suite.  If
you have a Haskell application program, please send it to us (along
with suitable test data) to include!

<h2>Obtaining the NoFib suite</h2>

<p>The NoFib suite lives in the same CVS repository as GHC.  To grab
the code, see the instructions on accessing the CVS repository <a
href="http://www.haskell.org/ghc/docs/latest/html/building/sec-cvs.html">here</a>.
