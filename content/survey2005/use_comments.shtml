>I like functional programming, and Haskell in particular.  I use Haskell as my &quot;secret weapon&quot; for many of my projects, typically internally because my clients want deliverables in more common languages such as Java or C#.  Haskell makes it easy to prototype tricky systems and get their logic right.  Then I can translate the logic into the target language.  I also use Haskell for internal development tools (like PXSL).  All of my Haskell work is in GHC.  (I haven't used Hugs since GHCi came out.)  I find GHC to be fast, featureful, and reliable.</TD

>I will likely start using GHC at work at some point, but find myself handicapped by the fact that glue code tools usually assume C, Perl, or other more traditional languages. In the same way, 3rd party libraries are typically intended for mainstream languages. This means that using Haskell will not pay unless there's a need for a large chunk of code that doesn't need glue, libraries, or a GUI.

I very much wish this was otherwise, because I find myself significantly more productive in Haskell, despite the vast bulk of my experience being with imperative languages. Not to mention I really enjoy programming in the language.

(Ultimatetley, I would like to make the course-work Haskell-based. Now
it's Java.) I quite often show examples &quot;live&quot;, during lectures, using GHCi.
I've tried the same thing in a course on formal languages and automata.

I use GHC in my research. Over the last few years that has mainly been
for Functional Reactive Programming. But whenever I need to implement
something, Haskell is my language of choice, and GHC my Haskell implementation
of choice, unless the environment is such that GHC does not run, in which
case I might resort to Hugs.
