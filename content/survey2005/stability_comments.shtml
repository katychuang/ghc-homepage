>I remember some legacy things (like ghc-pkg -l) being replaced or augmented in a backward-incompatible way. Worse, some of badly designed features are replaced by other hacks. Example: One thing that is broken in ghc-pkg description is the extra_ld_opts field which should contain options that the linker understands. Instead it contains options that are undestood by gcc. The driver should add the popper prefixes itself since I as a user don't know that gcc is used underneath. How is this going to work if c-- is used instead of gcc?

It would be nice if most features of ghc could be checked without reverting to comparing the version number.</TD
