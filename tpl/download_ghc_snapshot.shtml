<h2>Snapshot of 5.03 (ghc-5.03.20020410), released 11 April 2002</h2>

<p>Another snapshot along the 5.03 line, we expect this to be the last
snapshot before 5.04.  As before, there are NO GUARANTEES as to the
stability of this release, but it has passed our three-stage bootstrap
and all but one(!) of the 754 regressions tests passed.  Documentation
is also still lagging behind the new features.

<p>Changes since the previous snapshot (5.03.20020204):
<ul>

<li>GHC switched over to the new hierarchical library structure for
its base libraries.  The old hslibs and the standard Haskell 98
libraries are still there, so you shouldn't notice any difference for
existing code.  We're currently working on documenting the new library
structure for the next release.

<p><li>The syntax for implicit parameters has changed: implicit bindings
are now introduced with the <tt>let</tt> keyword instead of
<tt>with</tt>.  The bindings in a <tt>let</tt> must be either all
implicit bindings or all explicit, not a mixture of the two.  The old
<tt>with</tt> syntax will be supported for a couple of versions or so,
but will elicit a warning message from the compiler if you use it.

<p><li>Foreign export dynamic is allegedly working in GHCi.

<p><li>Generics are working again.

<p><li>Explicit kind annotations can now be given on type variables.
See the documentation (type system extensions, explicitly-kinded
quantification) for more details.

<p><li>Interface files are now in a binary format for speed of
reading/writing.  Use <tt>ghc --show-iface</tt> to show the textual
representation of an interface.  The synatx of <tt>.hi-boot</tt> files
has changed, and is now much more readable.

</ul>

<h2>Snapshot of 5.03 (ghc-5.03.20020204), released 5 February 2002</h2>

There have been a number of significant improvements made to GHC since
the 5.02 sources were branched off the main GHC development tree, but
we're not quite ready to make a full 5.04 release yet.  However, we're
keen to get feedback on the new features from people that don't have
easy access to CVS or don't have the time & patience to build GHC from
scratch, so we're making a snapshot release of the current GHC, in
source and binary form.
<p>
There are NO GUARANTEES as to the stability of this release, although
we do know it has passed our basic three-stage bootstrap test and run
the regression tests successfully.  In some cases the documentation
hasn't been fully updated to reflect the new features yet.
<p>
Briefly, the changes relative to 5.02.2 are:
<ul>
<li> The type system now supports arbitrary rank polymorphism,
     given appropriate type annotations.
<p>
<li> Heap profiling has had a major overhaul and now supports
     retainer profiling and biographical profiling ala nhc98.
<p>
<li> Major improvements to the native code generators.  You can now
     compile any and all code through them, including the Prelude.
<p>
<li> The FFI syntax has been updated to match the latest version
     of the FFI Haskell 98 Addendum.
<p>
<li> newtypes support deriving *any* class for which the
     underlying type is also an instance.
<p>
<li> Linear implicit parameters: a highly experimental feature.
<p>
<li> GHCi has several new commands:
     <ul>
     <li><code>:show bindings</code>, to list the bindings made on the command
	  line,
     <li><code>:show modules</code>, to show which modules are loaded,
     <li><code>:module</code> has been enhanced as per the discussion on the
         mailing list (syntax is still experimental - feedback
	   welcome).
     <li><code>:browse</code>  similar to Hugs' <code>:browse</code>
	  command.
     </ul>
</ul>

And many other minor changes & bugfixes.
<p>

     This installer relies on the Windows Installer runtime to
     operate. If, after having downloaded the above file,
     double-clicking on the MSI file doesn't start up the installer,
     the likely cause is that you don't have the Windows Installer
     runtime installed on your machine.  You can download it from
     Microsoft:

       <li><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/release.asp?releaseid=32832">
              Windows NT and 2000 version</a></li>
       </ul>
       <p>
       Install the appropriate version, then double-click
       again on the MSI file.
