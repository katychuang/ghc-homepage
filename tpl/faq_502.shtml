<h2>GHC 5.02 Mini-FAQ</h2>

This page lists known problems for the 5.02 release, with workarounds.

<ul>

  <li>The interactive system complains about missing symbols like
  <tt>CC_LIST</tt> when loading previously compiled .o files.
  <p>
  This probably means the .o files in question were compiled for
  profiling
  (with <tt>-prof</tt>).  Workaround: recompile them without
  profiling.  We really ought to detect this situation and give a
  proper
  error message.
  <p>
  </li>

  <li>Not really a bug, but ... if the interactive system complains
  about
  missing symbols in a library, and you know those symbols should be
  supplied by a shared object (<tt>.so</tt>) file, remember that you
  can specify names of <tt>.so</tt>'s on the ghci command line.  These
  extra libraries are then also searched by the runtime linker.
  You can also use the <tt>-L</tt> and <tt>-l</tt> flags on the ghci
  command line, and they work in the usual way.
  </p>
  </li>

  <li>Linking a program causes the following error on Linux:
  <pre>
  /usr/bin/ld: cannot open -lgmp: No such file or directory
  </pre>
   The problem is that your system doesn't have the GMP library
  installed.  If this is a RedHat distribution, install the
  RedHat-supplied gmp-devel package, and the gmp package if you don't
  already have it.  There have been reports that installing the RedHat
  packages also works for SuSE (SuSE don't supply a shared gmp library).
  </p>
  </li>

  <li>Can't run GHCi on Linux, because it complains about a missing
  <tt>libreadline.so.3</tt>.

  <p>Newer Linuxes (SuSE 7.1, possibly RH 7.X, possibly Mandrake 8.X)
  only come with <tt>libreadline.so.4</tt>.  Installing from an
  appropriate RPM is a good way to avoid this problem.  If you can't
  do this (perhaps because we don't have an RPM for your flavour of
  Linux), then you might be able to get things working by making a
  symbolic link from libreadline.so.4 to libreadline.so.3.  We tried
  this on a SuSE 7.1 box and it seemed to work.  </p></li>

  <li>Solaris users may sometimes get link errors due to libraries
  needed by GNU Readline.  We suggest you try linking in some
  combination
  of the 
  <tt>termcap</tt>, <tt>curses</tt> and <tt>ncurses</tt> libraries, by 
  giving <tt>-ltermcap</tt>, <tt>-lcurses</tt> and <tt>-lncurses</tt>
  respectively.  If you encounter this problem, we would appreciate
  feedback on it, since we don't fully understand what's going on here.
  </p>
  </li>

  <li>When I try to start ghci (probably one I compiled myself) it says
  <pre>
   ghc-5.02: not built for interactive use
  </pre>
  To build a working ghci, you need to build GHC 5.02 with itself; the above
  message appears if you build it with 4.08.X, for example.  It'll
  still work fine for batch-mode compilation, though.  Note that you
  really must build with exactly the same version of the compiler.
  Building 5.02 with 5.00.2, for example, may or may not give a
  working interactive system; it
  probably won't, and certainly isn't supported.
  Note also that you can build 5.02 with any older compiler, back to
  4.08.1,
  if you don't
  want a working interactive system; that's OK, and supported.</li>
  <p>

  <p><li><p>When I use a foreign function that takes or returns a float, it
  gives the wrong answer, or crashes.
  <p>You should use <a href="docs/5.02/set/sec-foreign.html"><tt>-#include</tt></a>.
  </li>

  <p><li><p>My program that uses a really large heap crashes on Windows.
  <p>For utterly horrible reasons, programs that use more than 128Mb of heap
  won't work when compiled dynamically on Windows (they should be fine
  statically compiled).
  </li>
  
  <p><li><p>GHC doesn't like filenames containing <tt>+</tt>.
  <p>Indeed not. You could change <tt>+</tt> to <tt>p</tt> or <tt>plus</tt>.
  </li>
  
  <p><li><p>When I open a FIFO (named pipe) and try to read from it, I
  get EOF immediately.  <p>This is a consequence of the fact that GHC
  opens the FIFO in non-blocking mode.  The behaviour varies from OS to
  OS: on Linux and Solaris you can wait for a writer by doing an explicit
  <tt>threadWaitRead</tt> on
  the file descriptor (gotten from <tt>Posix.handleToFd</tt>) before
  the first read, but
  this doesn't work on FreeBSD.  A workaround for all systems is to open
  the FIFO for writing yourself, before (or at the same time as) opening
  it for reading.
  </li>

  <p><li><p>When I <tt>foreign import</tt> a function that returns
  <tt>char</tt> or <tt>short</tt>, I get garbage back.
  <p>This is a known bug, GHC currently doesn't mask out the more
  significant bits of the result.  It doesn't manifest with gcc 2.95,
  but apparently shows up with g++ and gcc 3.0.  We'll fix it after
  the 5.02 release.
